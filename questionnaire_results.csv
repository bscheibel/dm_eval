The problem with version 1 is related to the two numbers being close to each other where the lack of units could make it confusing. After a certain time analyzing the rule, it becomes clear that the count happens when a certain temperature (26 degrees) is reached and exceeded. But this is not clear at first glance. What if the two numbers are in similar ranges? e.g. temperature.count(>=26.0)>=26.0.

Version 2 could be a good rule, but some questions pop up, such as: Why is intervall3 being skipped? Why the need to split those intervals? How do I know how many intervals there are (without reading the explanation outside of the rule)? Could there be a way to abstract over those 5 intervals? For example, the rule could be restated as the question: Was there in any of the intervals a case, where a certain temperature has been exceeded? (it could look like: any( max(temperature_interval_*), > 25.5 ), or any( max(temperature_interval_[1-5]), > 25.5 ). If ALL of the intervals have to exceed a certain threshold, then simply change 'any' to 'all': all( max(temperature_interval_*), > 25.5 )","","5 (strongly agree)","5 (strongly agree)","3","4","4","4","4","2","2","2","3","4","2","2","4","4","4","4","4","4","4","Version 1 and Version 3 are equivalent as first choices, where 3 seems to introduce constants for tolerance.

Version 1 is very clear.

Version 3 has the same problem as in the first examples (no unit, thus numbers close to each other can get confusing).

Version 2: diameter.last makes sense. But connecting it to specific casenames makes the rule less readable.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
